# Speech-to-Text

Both the Microsoft speech recognition SDK and the REST API support the following languages (locales). To improve accuracy, customization is offered for a subset of the languages through uploading Audio + Human-labeled Transcripts or Related Text: Sentences. Pronunciation customization is currently only available for en-US and de-DE. Learn more about customization [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-custom-speech).

# Speech translation

The Speech Translation API supports different languages for speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation. The source language must always be from the [Speech-to-Text (above)](#speech-to-text) language table. The available target languages depend on whether the translation target is speech or text. You may translate incoming speech into more than [60 languages](https://www.microsoft.com/translator/business/languages/). A subset of these languages are available for [speech synthesis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support#text-languages).
